When compared to typing, voice search is 3x faster, more ergonomic and the queries are more natural and expressive. This extension enables you to click once on a browser icon and perform a search with your voice.

This voice search extension is part of my effort to bring voice forward experiences to the browser. I think the main reason typing is more popular than speaking is because the keyboard preceded the microphone, and it took long for speech-to-text software to reach the point of understanding accents. It's about time we reversed the statistic!

When compared to typing, voice is:

* üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Faster: Like 3X faster than typing.
* üçπ Easier: You can dictate notes while pacing, eating, driving.
* üë∂ Natural: Voice queries are more expressive, leading to more featured snippets in search results.
* ‚ôø Accessible: Everyone can speak, 2yr olds, tired grannies, illitrates, name it.

My goal is to make it voice interaction as ubiquitous as typing... on the web. There are two parts to it

üë• Helping end-users discover and use voice input.
üè¢ Working with publishers to make their content more accessible through voice.
