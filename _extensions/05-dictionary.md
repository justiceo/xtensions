# It relies on injecting a script to modify the google.com page that is in an iframe.

The internet is a melting pot of languages, which makes a Dictionary (+ thesarus) a handy tool for netizens. The browser extension resulting from this supports:

* Showing the varying definitions of the given word in different contexts.
* Pronounciation guide in audio format.
* Real-world usages of the word in sentences.
* Complex words used in the definition are hyperlinked.
* Support for all the major languages of the world from Arabic to German.
* A thesarus of synonyms and antonyms.

Under the hood, the extension is using Google's dictionary API, which in turn integrates with major dictionary providers around the world like Oxford. I estimate that there are over a 100 dictionary extensions on the Chrome Webstore, and I hope this is the alternative you're looking for.

Here is a list of languages supported:
 - Arabic
 - Brazilian Portuguese
 - Chinese (Simplified)
 - Chinese (Traditional)
 - Czech
 - Dutch
 - English (UK)
 - English (US)
 - French
 - German
 - Hindi
 - Italian
 - Japanese
 - Korean
 - Russian
 - Slovak
 - Spanish
 - Turkish
