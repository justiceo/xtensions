### Features
* **Automatic Github Pages generation**: Files added in the `gh-pages` sub-directory are branched to create a Github page automatically. This is useful for static pages like help, welcome and feedback pages.
* **Typescript to Js**: Write your entire chrome extension in Typescript and have it transpiled to JavaScript.
* **E2E extension test**: Start up a chrome browser with your extension installed, write your tests in Jasmine.
* **Generate extension icons**: Forget the pain of generating icons of different size to meet icons requirements.
* **Manifest V3 Compatible**: Easier submission to the Chrome Webstore.
* **Automatic translation**: The messages for all supported i18n locales are auto-generated from the English version.
* **Zero Dependencies**: This starter is minimal to avoid [supply-chain attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/npm-supply-chain-attack-impacts-hundreds-of-websites-and-apps/) which is rampant with Js projects.
* **Welcome and Uninstall pages**: To give your project a head start, welcome pages are great for demos and uninstall pages provide a thoughtful exit.
* **Utilities for common tasks**: Comes with helpers logging, storage, and requesting feedback.
