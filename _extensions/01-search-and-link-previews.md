This is my solution to the too-many-open-tabs problem. Opening a new tab is easy, closing it is hard. This extension helps by showing links and search results in a preview pane inside the current tab, that way I don't have to open a new tab in the first place.

It could start with me reading [List of investors killed by their own invention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_inventors_killed_by_their_own_invention), then 17 open tabs later, I find myself on [Donner Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donner_Party).
